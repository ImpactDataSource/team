### Recommended reading

Our exact mix of culture and process are unique to us, but the principles are
taken from tried-and-true principles in use by other teams. While the goal of
these documents are to outline the most important components of our process, it
is not intended to be a comprehensive overview on the core subjects such as
Agile. The following are recommended for further reading as complementary to our
team's approach and more in-depth on some of the principles:
