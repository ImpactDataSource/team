Documentation
==

All classes and server-side code should be documented with
[JSDoc style](http://usejsdoc.org) comments, identifying the purpose of the
function, arguments, and return values. Additional documentation can be
formatted with Markdown and [Docco style](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/)
comments to describe the purpose and intent of the code when it is not obvious
by reading the code alone.

Project documentation can be generated with `npm run docs`. The documentation
generator will parse comments and display them alongside the code itself.
