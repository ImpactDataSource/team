Contributing guidelines

Any development must have a corresponding story before work has begun on the
implementation. This story can take the form of a feature, bug or chore. More
information on the [Backlog](../process/BACKLOG.md) and our feature development
life cycle [can be found here](../process/FEATURES.md).
