While the goal of\nthese documents are to outline the most important components of our process, it\nis not intended to be a comprehensive overview on the core subjects such as\nAgile. The following are recommended for further reading as complementary to our\nteam's approach and more in-depth on some of the principles:\n\nA successful GIT branching model\nBetter Software and Stronger Teams\nThe Agile Samurai\n\n"},"process/BACKLOG.html":{"url":"process/BACKLOG.html","title":"Backlog","keywords":"","body":"Backlog\nThe backlog for each project is managed through Pivotal Tracker.\nStory types\nAny development must have a corresponding story before work has begun on the implementation. This story can take the form of a feature, bug or chore.\n\nFeatures are vertical slices of functionality that delivery business value in the form of software. They represent a complete set of usable functionality and are sized according to their relative difficulty using a point value based on the fibonacci sequence. Typically stories that are sized at 13 points or higher should be broken into smaller slices if possible so long as they deliver a complete set of functionality.\n\nBugs are any technical issue that exists with currently deployed features. Bugs can also represent refactoring required on existing code. Bugs cannot be created for features that are in progress as these should be included in the feature work itself. Bugs are not sized.\n\nChores represent small updates to existing code that may otherwise be categorized as a feature but are too minor in nature. These can be textual updates, typos, or documentation.\n\n\nStories are categorized by Type and further grouped into Epics using Labels representing areas of the application or large feature-sets. Milestones are used to track progress against sprints, releases and important dates to the business stakeholders.\nFeatures\nBefore work on a feature can begin, it must be thoroughly defined with at least the following:\n\nFeature title A feature title should include the common persona, requested feature, and a \"so that\" which describes the value this feature delivers to either the persona or the business: \"As a (user/admin/dev), I want (a goal), so that (benefit).\"\n\nContext Context is one of the most important parts of the feature and should be sufficiently detailed so that anyone reviewing the story knows the \"Why\". This is not another format for specifications or requirements. Rather, it should help to explain both the motivation for creating the issue and what is a valuable outcome for the user.\n\nImplementation Implementation contains any relavent data necessary or useful when building this feature. This section needs to make more sense to the developer than the business stakeholder. This isn't necessarily a task list as one of these is provided by Pivotal.\n\nHow to Demo This section should contain step-by-step instructions on how to demo the feature to the business stakeholder. It is important to keep this section free of any technical descriptors or complexities. It should be as simple as \"do this, expect that\". The How to Demo also provides a great starting point for an End to End test to accompany the feature.\n\nQuestions This is where developers can capture questions they need to ask others later. These can be technical questions to ask other devs or business logic questions to ask the product owners. Answered questions can be put alongside the question in the story description or can be further discussed in the activity section at the bottom of the story.\n\nTasks The tasks sections serves as a checklist to the developer and should represent the steps necessary to implement the story. Tasks should be broken up sufficiently so that no one task takes longer than one day. Tasks can and should be more technical in nature and serve as a leading indicator to the progress made on the feature.\n\n\nBugs and Chores\nBugs and chores must have full definition before the story can be started, but do not require the same ceremony as a feature. Generally, they should have the following:\n\nContext Optional for bug stories. This is a space to provide greater clarification than a story title allows.\n\nImplementation For bugs this should include details on the user, operating system, and any other environment information that is specific to the bug being experienced. Bugs need to include both expected and actual results from a user perspective. Chores should clearly capture the requested change with as much detail as necessary for the developer to have a clear definition of done.\n\nSteps to Reproduce Specific to bugs, this represents the \"How to Demo\" for the fix. These steps when followed should result in the original bug being observed for diagnosis and testing during development. During demo following these steps should result in the expected behavior as outlined in the requirements.\n\n\nWorkflow\nAll issues are moved between Pipelines representing their current stage within the development lifecycle. Currently, the following workflow is observed:\n\n\nIcebox The Icebox generally represents items that are low priority in the backlog. Stories in this category should be populated with enough information on the story so that its purpose and business value are clear. Remember, some Icebox stories may stay in this category for a length of time before being prioritized.\n\nBacklog Stories in this pipeline are prioritized and ready for development. The developer should make an effort to fully populate all aspects of a story before clicking \"Start.\"\n\nCurrent Iteration When a developer starts work on a story, it moves to the Current Iteration column. Each Story in this section should have an assigned owner who is responsible for its completion. If a team member decides to take on a task, they simply self-assign the Story and click start, instantly communicating to the rest of the team that the task is underway. Effort should be made to limit In Progress stories to one per team member, though exceptions can be made for blocked stories.\n\nThere are several states a \"started\" story may be in:\n\nStarted This story is being actively worked on.\nFinished Functionality is complete for this feature or issues are resolved for this bug. Completed code is pushed to the accompanying feature/bug branch.\nDelivered Code has been QA'd by other devs and is ready to be pushed live to develop branch and deployed to demo environment.\nAccepted Completed functionality/bug fix has been demonstrated to developers and product owners and code is ready to be merged into master branch\nRejected Functioality demonstration did not behave as planned or completion criteria was not fulfilled in the eyes of the product owner. Revise and re-start story.\nChores only have a Started and Finished* state and are immediately moved to the done column when \"Finish\" button is clicked.\n\n\n\n\n\nDone These issues have been accepted by the product owner or business stakeholder and no additional work is required. All code should meet the agreed-upon Definition of Done criteria and is awaiting final merge into the release branch.\n\n\n"},"process/FEATURES.html":{"url":"process/FEATURES.html","title":"Feature development","keywords":"","body":"Feature development\nFeature development happens on independent branches using the Git Flow style of\nbranching and includes both automated and manual tests before staging, review,\nand final deployment. The following is a high level overview of the development\nlifecycle on each feature:\n\nFeature development begins by branching off the latest stable develop\nbranch in GIT. Once finished, a pull request is created to signify completion.\n\nTravis runs all functional unit tests and a suite of responsive browser-based end to end tests and reports status in the pull request.\n\nStatic analysis is run on the newly committed code and reported in the pull\nrequest. Meanwhile, a manual peer review of both the code and functionality is\nconducted by another developer on the team.\n\nDuring the manual review process, a UAT environment is automatically created\nwith the new feature deployed. After the feature is approved the code is merged\nand deployed to Staging and the UAT environment is spun down.\n\nAccepted features from the previous sprint are pushed to the release branch\nwhich kicks off a final round of automated tests in Travis before building and\ndeploying the new release.\n\n\n\n*Note: A lot of the above represents an ideal set up, some of which is not in place in our Ember 2.0 upgrade app.\n"},"process/OPEN_SOURCE.html":{"url":"process/OPEN_SOURCE.html","title":"Open source","keywords":"","body":"Open source\nOur team will actively use and contribute to existing open source projects in\nour application development.

Anyone on the team can submit a\nproposal or amendment to our guidelines through a pull request.\nWhile care should be taken when selecting third-party code to integrate in our\ncodebase, it should always be considered preferential to use an existing tool\nthat does the job rather than re-creating our own. Generally, the following\nshould be prioritized when evaluating the implementation of new functionality:\n\nUse an existing open source library.\nDoes it have a history of being maintained by multiple parties?\nAre we using the library to it's full capability or only a small portion\nthat could be solved by a more purpose-built utility function?\nCan it's use reduce security or performance to the host application?\n\n\nImplement needed features on a library we already use.\nDo these features fit within the scope or intended use of the library?\nCan we reasonably expect favorable response by maintainer(s) to the feature?\n\n\nImplement needed feature in our own modular component.\nCan this functionality be used in our other applications?\nCan this functionality be beneficial to anyone outside of our team?\nRelease at private namespace and evaluate for public NPM publishing.\n\n\nImplement purpose-built feature in host application.\n\n"},"architecture/":{"url":"architecture/","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Solution architecture\nSpecific architecture decisions will be documented in their corresponding\nrepositories. With that said, we will generally use the following technologies:\n\nEmber for front-end and client-facing UX (Includes Ember-cli and Ember Data)\nExpress for server-side API and models\nSASS for structured styling and responsive CSS\nGrunt for server-side task running\n\nWhenever appropriate, new applications which can be built off the main services\nAPI will be structured as independent lightweight front-end applications.\nFollowing best practices, all applications store sensitive configuration in the\nenvironment and not the codebase. Local configuration can generally be specified\nin a .env file in the root of your application, which is excluded from GIT.\nDeployment\nHeroku is used for all production applications, QA\nenvironments, and review apps. Each application will be configured in a Pipeline. This ensures that\nall code being reviewed at any stage in the feature development lifecycle is\ndone so on an exact replica of the production environment.\nIBM Compose is used for some databases and provides\nautomated backups and disaster recovery in addition to general database\nenvironment optimization and configuration.\nMLab is used as a database host in some cases,\nconfigured as a heroku add-on. This service also provides automatic backups and\ndisaster recovery.\nDue to ephemeral file systems on all production applications, any permanent file\nstorage will utilize Amazon S3 buckets. When files\nare uploaded by users, a CORS upload will be used to transfer the file directly\nbetween the user and S3 without involving the production application.\nCloudflare is used as both a CDN and a layer of\nthreat mitigation. If custom proxying is required an additional proxy server may\nbe used which runs NGINX. Generally, all caching should be\ndeferred to either Cloudflare or NGINX to avoid cache conflicts and\nprevent deployment complications.\n"},"contributing/":{"url":"contributing/","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Contributing guidelines\nAny development must have a corresponding story before work has begun on the\nimplementation.

With the exception of generic components that we choose to\nopen source, all repositories will be set to private in our\nGitHub account. Even so, care should be taken against committing any credentials\nor potentially sensitive information.\nBranching\nProjects follow the GIT Flow branching model, with development being performed\non named branches. When a feature is complete, a pull request is opened in\nGitHub for review by another member of the team. Traditional GIT Flow allows for\nfeature, bug, and chore branches. Below is a summary of each type of\nbranch and its purpose:\n\nmaster Should always represent what is currently deployed to production.\nNever work directly on master\n\ndevelop Represents the current working branch. Should be mostly stable but\nis ok to break. This should automatically deploy to the demo environment where\nmost QA will take place.\n\nfeature/* Feature branch. These branches should always branch off of and\nmerge back on to develop. Format should be\nfeature/brief_functionality_description_121984369 where number represents\nPivotal story id.\n\nbug/* Bug branch. Same as feature where it always branches off of develop\nbut branch name is prefaced with \"bug/...\".\n\nhotfix/* Hotfix branch. Like a bug, but the functionality is more urgent\nand needs to be released before the next release cycle. Always branches off of\nmaster and is merged into master and develop when completed. Is usually\naccompanied by a mid-cycle production release.\n\n\nBranch Names should be a 2 or 3 word description followed by the Pivotal story Id.\n\nie. upgrade_node_version_120148137\n\nOnce the feature is complete and marked as Ready to Merge, all commits can be\nsquashed, if desired, into a single commit following our\nCommit Message Format guidelines.

Refactoring neighboring code or\nfixing bugs should happen on their own branch unless they are directly required\nfor the feature work being performed.\nCommit message format\nAlso look into Google's Commit Message Guidelines as they provide a great\nexample of writing which are easier to follow when looking through a project\nhistory.\nThe header of a commit message should incude the Pivotal Tracker story id along\nwith a brief description of the work completed.\nex.
